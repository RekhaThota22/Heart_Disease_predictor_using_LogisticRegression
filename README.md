# Heart_Disease_predictor_using_LogisticRegression
🚀 Just completed a Logistic Regression project on Heart Disease Prediction! ❤️🔍

As part of my journey to become a job-ready Data Analyst/Data Scientist, I worked on a real-world dataset (heart.csv) to predict the likelihood of heart disease using Logistic Regression.

📊 Key Highlights:

✅ Performed data cleaning: handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized data.

🧠 Built a logistic regression model to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease (target: output = 1 or 0).

📈 Evaluated model performance using:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

ROC Curve & AUC

Confusion Matrix

🔍 Interpreted coefficients to understand the impact of features like cholesterol, age, thalach, cp, etc.

🛠 Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

📌 Why this matters: Logistic regression is a core ML algorithm for binary classification. This project helped me understand how to connect statistics with real-world health applications, and how to validate a classification model.
